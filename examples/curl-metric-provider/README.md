# Curl Metric Provider Example

In this example, it is expected that you have a `busybox` deployment
on a kubernetes cluster. Then, this application is deployed
on the cluster and starts running the `CustomPodAutoscaler` code.

Simulate changes to a real-world metric by hitting this application
using curl. `CustomPodAutoscaler` will pick up those value changes
and run its scaling code.

## Setting Up

Set up the example using minikube.
